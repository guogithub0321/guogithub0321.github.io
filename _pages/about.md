I completed both my undergraduate and master's studies in psychology at Sun Yat-sen University. Driven by my diverse interests, I acquired multifaceted hands-on expertise in research, including cognition, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics and latent variable modeling. After graduation, I worked for a leading internet company in Beijing for a short time. Currently, I'm a data mining engineer at a startup focused on digital therapy for mental health. This role has not only highlighted the significance of psychological and neuroscience research but has also deepened my insight into the complex challenges of treating psychiatric disorders. These realizations solidified my determination to pursue a career in scientific research. By delving into the neural mechanism of cognition, I aim to enhance our understanding of both normal and abnormal cognitive processes, contributing to the advancement of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
