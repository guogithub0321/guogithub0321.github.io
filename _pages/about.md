Hi, I am Zhihan (Hannah) Guo and welcome to my website! I am a first-year PhD student in Psychology at Emory University, advised by <a href="https://www.jaredmedina.com" target="_blank">Prof. Jared Medina</a>. My research interests include how we perceive our own bodies and the various factors that influence our representation of our bodies.

Prior to that, I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Psychology at Sun Yat-sen University in China, where I engaged in research related to cognitive science, psychometrics, and neuroscience.
