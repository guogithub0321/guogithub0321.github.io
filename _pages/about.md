Hi, I am Zhihan(Hannah) Guo and welcome to my website! I am currently a first-year PhD student in Psychology at Emory University, working with [Dr. Jared Medina](https://www.jaredmedina.com). My research interests include the neural mechanisms of body representation, particularly how it is shaped by sensory inputs and affected by brain damage.

Prior to that, I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Psychology at Sun Yat-sen University in China, where I engaged in research related to cognitive science, psychometrics, and neuroscience.
