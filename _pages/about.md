I completed both my undergraduate and master's degrees in psychology at Sun Yat-sen University. Currently, I am employed at a startup focused on mental health. I am interesting in the neural and computational basis of cognition, and understanding how its variations are linked to dysfunctional thoughts and behaviors. 

You can find my CV here: [CV]()(../assets/zhihan_guo_cv.pdf).
